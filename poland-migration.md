title: Humans as a weapon

There's been an continuous border crisis in Poland since 2021. That summer, first migrants were lured in by a ruthless dictator to be weaponised in his political games. But was he stupid? Did we ask ourselves what's his goal? How to score at his own game? Of course we didn't.

We toy with human lives, and we're bad at it. It's been the dictator's plan all along; demoralise further our state and society, then point the finger and say: "See, the pesky Poles are being fascist again, just like they were with us before the war." The oppression of the Belarus' Polish minority - from destruction of our sacred places to [false imprisonment](https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-poczobut-polish-activist-trial/32225575.html) of local Poles - clearly shows the state works against us, and the oppression all Belarussians face proves its disregard for human life. Łukaszenko's aimed to bring us down to his level, and it worked.

We're pushing back the migrants. We're leaving them to die of cold and hunger in the wilderness of Europe's last primeval forest. It's the easy way, but it's not the right way, and it's not the moral way. We've lowered ourselves to Łukaszenko's level, trying to weaponise the migrants _against_ him. In that, we've forgotten that you don't wrestle a pig, because you both get dirty and the pig likes it. 

We fought for so long to be on the side of democracy, liberalism and equality. The dismantling of communism was our hard-won success and a symbol of a better tomorrow. Yet, we succumbed to humanity's worst instincts, provoked by a known brute. Łukaszenko has simply done what he's been doing well. 

We made it easier. We've been electing a motley crew of authoritarians, liars, crooks and scumbags [with ties](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62900724-kaczy-ski-i-jego-paj-czyna-tkanie-sieci-1949-1995) to [the Kremlin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/russia-linked-2014-wiretapping-scandal-poland), world's biggest mob. Blinded with their money, we turned silent on their crimes. 

In that time, with our mandate, the ruling party's dismantling the institutions that make our state secure. They're destroying our credibility among allies, ruining any little trust we had in our state, and pitting us against each another. In that, they've achieved a divided society alienated from any foreign friends it had. And who's winning in that? 

Russia. The fascist thug with atomic weapons bets on Europe's disunity. Several countries led questionable policies on Russia, but we - and Orban's Hungary - are the troyan horse. We're actively wrecking EU from within.
