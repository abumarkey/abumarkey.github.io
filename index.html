<h1>Hi! My name’s Marek Fronc. </h1>
  <img src="https://imgur.com/download/VlGH9Va/" alt="foto" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" />
<p>I’m a mobile photographer, and blogger based in Kraków, Poland.
  <br><br>
My chief interest is in the politics, society and pop-culture of the Middle East. I had spent four years in Bahrain, where I went to high school. I now study the region at university, at undergraduate level (expected to finish 2022).  
<br><br>
In terms of photography, landscape pictures is where I’m at. Most often
of cities, as I’m an urban child, yet I venture into the green as well. I have an experience with point and shoot cameras, but moved to mobile photography by 2013. I find smartphones (iPhone 11 currently) to be the quickest and handiest cameras, while offering a good image quality. 
<br><br>
I occasionally write about politics and society <a href="https://write.as/abumarkey">here</a>. I also have a <a href="https://arabizmy.writeas.com/">blog</a> about the Middle East, which I update in Polish. I also speak Czech, and English, as well as learn Arabic and German. 
  <br></br>
An <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ulli-diemer-what-is-libertarian-socialism">anarcho-socialist</a>, and a feminist, I also support equal rights for LGBT+ and all ethnicities. Capitalism exploits us, and the ruling class seeks to divide us to divert our attention from it.</p>
