<h1>Hi! My name's Marek Fronc. </h1>
<p>I'm a mobile photographer, and blogger based in Krakow, Poland.
My interests lay in the Middle East. I’d spent four years in Bahrain,
and now study the region at university (undergraduate). My focus is
pop-culture, society and politics. I’m also interested in those of Europe.
<br>
In terms of photography, landscape pictures is where I’m at. Most often
of cities, as I’m an urban child, but I venture into the green as well.
<br>
I occasionally write about politics and society <a href="https://write.as/abumarkey">here</a>. I also have a <a href="https://arabizmy.writeas.com/">blog</a> <br>
about the Middle East, which I update in Polish. I also speak Czech, and English.
