<h1>Hi! My name's Marek Fronc. </h1>
<p>I'm a mobile photographer, and blogger based in Krakow, Poland. <br>
My interests lay in the Middle East. I’d spent four years in Bahrain, <br>
and now study the region at university (undergraduate). My focus is <br>
pop-culture, society and politics. I’m also interested in those of Europe.<br>
<br>
In terms of photography, landscape pictures is where I’m at. Most often <br>
of cities, as I’m an urban child, but I venture into the green as well. <br>
<br>
I occasionally write about politics and society <a href="https://write.as/abumarkey">here</a>. I also have a <a href="https://arabizmy.writeas.com/">blog</a> <br>
about the Middle East, which I update in Polish. I also speak Czech, and English.
